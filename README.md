# CliffSense-MSP430

The CS01 is a seismic sensor that will assist in predicting and detecting a collapse of bluffs overlooking beach areas. The sensor will take samples of vibrational motion, soil conductivity, temperature, and tilt data via a microcontroller to analyze whether the event is of an impending collapse. If the event is true, the sensor will make use of its connection to an RF transmitter to alert beachgoers on the bluff to move towards safety. The sensor is cored into the rock, entombed around 2.8”-3.0”, so that its cosmetics are unnoticeable. The transmitter’s 900Mhz antenna is placed near the surface of the rock to avoid detuning and degrading radio performance. The CS01 is powered by three 3.04” x 0.71” 3.2V batteries, and comes with an inductive charging coil to allow for rechargeability and long term deployment. 

The following diagram shows the intended function of the MSP430FR5994 microcontroller which the code consists of. The device begins with SPI initialization and finding the LSM6DS0X accelerometer. After successfully establishing the connection, the device loops measurement functions, loads the temperature data in “tmp” while gyroscope/acceleration values are loaded into struct “sample.” Lastly, the measurement data is written on to the SD Card. Note that the microcontroller communicates through UART to the BT Receiver (ESP32) and the LoRa which will receive its data through AT commands. The software for the MSP4305994 is implemented using the IDE, Code Composer Studio 11.0.0.
